老将希拉里•克林顿的顾问说她应该不会加速2015年早期的时间表来宣布她是否参加总统的竞选，尽管从周二国会选举后现任总统奥巴马的赞助商很快打来了为她进入竞争的重要电话。

在采访和电子邮件里交流，紧紧站在克林顿这边的六个政治特工提供了重叠的不希望她在这一年跳出来的原因列表。

当她不直接参与到竞选中时，她更加受欢迎。她最好后退，等待对于民主主义者期望的丑陋的竞选之夜稳定下来之后再说。当共和党希望开始撕裂每一部分时，她会从远离焦躁中受益。更多的，他们指出：克林顿在九月份在墨西哥一个场合上说过，她会在2015年1月1日后决定这些的可能性。

就像其他匿名场合上说的一样，克林顿一个顾问说，克林顿在11月和12月两个月的时间里会把精力放在慈善，政策事件和孩子克林顿夏洛克上。克林顿并不在公开场合讨论她的计划。一个克林顿的发言人婉拒了评论但是指出了她上一次提名时候的状态。

原文：Veteran Hillary Clinton advisers say she shouldn’t accelerate her early 2015 timetable for announcing whether she’ll run for president, despite calls from prominent backers of President Barack Obama for her to enter the race soon after Tuesday’s congressional elections.

In interviews and e-mail exchanges, six political operatives closely aligned with Clinton offered up overlapping lists of reasons why they don’t expect her to jump in this year.

She’s more popular when she’s not directly engaged in electoral politics, she’s better off waiting for things to settle out after what’s expected to be an ugly election night for Democrats, and she benefits from staying out of the fray while Republican hopefuls start to tear each other apart. Moreover, they note, Clinton said at an event in Mexico City in September she’ll decide “probably after” Jan. 1, 2015.

“Can’t we get through the holidays first?” asked Paul Begala, the strategist who helped Bill Clinton win the presidency in 1992 and is a consultant for the Clinton-backing super-PAC Priorities USA. “Do we really need to deny her her first Christmas with her first granddaughter? Really?”

Clinton will spend November and December focused on philanthropy, policy matters and baby Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, said one Clinton adviser who like most of the others spoke on the condition of anonymity because Clinton is not discussing her plans publicly. A Clinton spokesman declined to comment but pointed to her past statement about timing.
