A Hexo Theme for publishing a multi-part novel on the web.

Optimized for reading, using Jade and Sass rather than the default renderers.

In order to publish a book online, you'll need to add the chapters in reverse
order (Last Chapter posted earliest).

I have a pull request open for hexo that adds the ability to reverse the order.
See [Pull Request](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo/pull/936) to determine
which release of Hexo it's available in.

_config.yml for the theme is where you set your author bio and picture url.
